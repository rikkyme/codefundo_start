We intend to make a model based on soft computing, to provide probability of flood in a certain region.
For our convinence we have considered the region of interest as India.
We initially propose to train our function based on following pramaters.
      i) Level of rain fall in that region, we intend to use preset model to pridict rainfall add our features to it.
      ii) Presence of Dam in the region(AS PRESENCE OF DAM CAN PROMOTE THE OCCURRENCE OF FLOOD)
      iii) El-nino winds and La-nino effect, through measurement of SOI(southern oscillation index).
      iv) Terrain factor and vegatation, controlling the surface run off of rain water.
      v) Proximity of river, and its upstream and downstream level.
We will show the probabitlity and intensity of flood through colour coding in the map of India.
